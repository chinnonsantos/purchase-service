## Running server

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server-headless

> Default ring port changed from ~~3000~~ to **9002**

## Running tests (TDD)

To test the project, run:

    lein midje

To test the project in development stage, run:

    lein midje :autotest

> Automatically reloading the test with each change

To test only **Unit tests** of the project, run:

    lein midje :filter unit

To test only **Assertion tests** of the project, run:

    lein midje :filter assertion

To check test coverage, run:

    lein cloverage --runner :midje

## E2E Testing

To perform a quick **End-to-End** test on this service (with cURL)

- Check health

      curl http://localhost:9002/

- Get balance

      curl http://localhost:9002/balance/:account-id/

  > The _:account-id_ is an [UUID][] informed when creating registration

[UUID]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier

- Get purchase list (from account ID)

      curl http://localhost:9002/purchase/from-account/:account-id/?tag=footwear&tag=furniture

  > The _:account-id_ is an [UUID][] informed when creating registration
  > **Filters have not been implemented yet!**

- Get purchase info (purchase details)

      curl http://localhost:9002/purchase/:purchase-id/

  > The _:purchase-id_ is an [UUID][] automatically generated by the service after registration

- Create a purchase

      curl -X POST \
      -d '{"account-id": "8b84c28c-8947-4e67-87d8-68f65ebca105", "type": "income", "value": 300.00, "origin": {"code": 0, "name": "bill payment"}, "tag": ["bill", "prepayment"]}' \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      localhost:9002/purchase/

- Hitting an invalid route

      curl http://localhost:9002/invalid/

To perform a complete automated **End-to-End** test on this service I recommend use the [Postman][]
